                    A tem of people made a special <b>sleeping pod</b> for <b>homeless people</b>. They are testing it in the city of Ulm, Germany.
                </p>
                <p>It is necessary to check if the pod is warm enough to keep homeless people safe from cold and wind. If the test is successful, the team wants to put the pods in other German cities, too. The pod has a solar panel on the roof which makes light and it also opens the door. The pod is from <b>metal and wood</b> and it is suitable for one person. The door unlocks in the evening and someone, who has no place to sleep, can stay inside. The pod is warm and there is fresh air inside.</p>
                <p>
                    When the door opens, social workers get a message. They check and clean the place the next day to make sure that it is ready for another person.

                    <b>2/ To take something out on someone</b> means to make someone suffer, even when it's not their fault. This phrasal verb is separable and needs an object. <u>Example:</u>
