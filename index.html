                <img class="hero-img" src="images/vaccine.jpg" alt="vaccine">

                <p>
                    More countries in the world are starting to <b>vaccinate</b> people against COVID-19, and some people would like to make vaccine <b>passports</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These passports would show that a person got the COVID-19 vaccine and that he could not spread the virus so easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many countries which depend on tourists are excited, and they would like to introduc vaccine passports. For businesses which <b>suffered</b> during the pandemic, a vaccine passport could be a big help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem is that tests showed that none of the COVID-19 vaccines was 100% effective. This means that some people who get the vaccine could still spread the virus. Another problem is that some countries started to vaccinate people months ago, but some countries are just starting. Also, older people got the vaccine earlier than younger people. Some people say that it is not fair that older people could travel because they would have the vaccine passport, but younger people could not.
