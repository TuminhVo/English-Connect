            <p>One of the reasons why we need to be able to speak English nowadays is because the world is becoming smaller. Thanks to the internet and our developing global economy, more and more people are using English as a common way to communicate with each other. So now it has become unavoidable that companies and large businesses will need to employ people who can speak more than their own native language, that is where English comes in. It is now officially considered as an international language.</p>
            <p>Of course, learning anything is difficult and English is no exception. However, there are ways to make the situation easier. I have come up with my own list of general rules of thumbs for learning English. Do you want to hear them? Do you want to know what they are? OK...let's go!</p>
            <p>Learning English takes time and patience. It cannot be rushed. Try to relax and take it easy. The most important thing you need at the beginning is a good vocabulary. Without words, you have nothing to work with. You must start with a strong foundation or base and slowly build on it, day by day! You must view English as a part of your body... just as you would an arm or leg. It must become a part of your everyday life. Daily practice is very important. Do not worry about making mistakes... In fact, the more mistakes you make, the more you will learn from them. Just like learning to ride a bike. Sometimes you fall off. So, what do you do? You get back on track and try again. Do not look at English as just another subject. Your attitude to English and the way you view it will decide how well you progress. Just as we say in English "No pain... no gain". The two most important words to remember when learning English are... practice and confidence. Practice English every day and be confident. You will find that the more you use English... the better your English will become and the more confident you become... Then the more you will want to use it. Make it a rule to tell yourself... I can do it... I can do it... I can do it!</p>

            <h2>Let's learn and apply</h2>
            <h2>Hit the books</h2>
            <p>Literally, hit the books means to physically hit, punch or slap your reading books. However, this is a common English idiom among students, especially American college students who have a lot of studying to do. It simply means "to study", and is a way of telling your friends that you're going to study.</p>
            <p>It could be for a final exam, a midterm test or even an English exam.</p>
            <p><b>Examples: </b><q>SORRY but I can't watch the game with you tonight, I have to <b>hit the books</b>. I have a huge exam next week!</q></p>
