                    <p>
                        I am sure that everyone wants to live as long as possible, but to do that is not easy at all. Thus, what should we do to be alive to one hundred?</p>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, we should pay attention to our ways of eating and drinking. Nowadays, it seems that people get fatter and fatter because of eating and drinking too much. They have a lot of chances to eat or drink now: birthdays, weddings, graduations, holidays, and even weekends. Morover, many people are <strong>poisoned</strong> because of eating <strong>carelessly</strong>, and quite a few people bear big bellies or suffer from heart diseases because of drinking alcohol or beer too much.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Secondly, we should keep our living environment plenty of fresh air. Living in close and <strong>stuffy</strong> rooms, breathing foul air, and not being enough out of doors will soon <strong>damage</strong> our health. Therefore, we should often clean our rooms, wash our pillow-cases and bedspreads, and open the windows.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Then, we should have regular physical exercise. If we do not get much exercise in our daily work, we should get it in outdoor activities such as playing sports, walking, jogging or swimming. It is proved that more and more people suffer from <strong>heart attacks</strong> because of not exercising sufficiently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, we should sleep enough. Staying up too late will spoil our nerves and ruin our health. Many people now stay up too late watch films or play games. Remember, <q><strong>Early to bed and early to rise make man healthy and wise</strong></q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, we should avoid bad habits such as smoking, taking drugs, committing ourselves to a life of <strong>debauchery</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I do not think what I have mentioned above is enough for us to live to one hundred. Can you work out more ways?

                    A phrasal verb is a verb plus a preposition or adverb which creates a meaning different from the original verb.
